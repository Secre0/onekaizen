                    <p>The incline dumbbell press targets the upper chest and shoulders. Start by setting a bench to a 30-45 degree incline. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level. Press the dumbbells up and together, then lower them back down slowly. <br>

                        <br>• Incline Dumbbell Press, Sit on the bench and lean back. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with hands positioned at your shoulders, elbows bent and angled down below your ribs. Relax your neck against the bench. Keep your feet flat on the floor. <br><br>

                            • Brace your core and press both dumbbells straight over your chest as you exhale. Keep your wrists straight (don't let them "cock" backward). At the top of the movement, the dumbbells should almost touch each other, and your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. <br><br>

                            • Reverse the movement and slowly lower the dumbbells to the top of your chest as you inhale. As you lower the dumbbells, your elbows should come down at roughly a 45-degree angle to your torso. They shouldn't splay out to the sides, pointing toward the side of the room. Instead, keep your elbows pointing to the floor. <br><br>

                            • Aim to complete sets of 8 to 12 reps. Start with one set and work up to two to three sets over time as you build strength. When you finish your set, safely exit the exercise by sitting up and placing the dumbbells on your knees before you stand up. Avoid dropping the dumbbells while you're lying on the incline bench. <br><br>

                    <p>This exercise targets the triceps. Hold a dumbbell with both hands behind your head. Keep your elbows close to your ears and extend your arms upwards, then slowly lower back to starting position. <br><br>

                        • By using dumbbells instead of a EZ-bar for the overhead extension you work each arm separately and ensure one stronger side isn’t carrying the weaker one, but it’s also worth doing the exercise with one arm at a time. This lets you focus on perfect form in that one arm, and also allows for a greater range of motion so you can be sure you’re working every part of the triceps with the move. As with all forms of the exercise, make sure you don’t overdo it with the weight you use and ideally you want to be able to rest the weight evenly in both palms

                        • Get down on all fours, placing your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. <br><br>

                            • Reverse the movement and slowly lower the dumbbells to the top of your chest as you inhale. As you lower the dumbbells, your elbows should come down at roughly a 45-degree angle to your torso. They shouldn't splay out to the sides, pointing toward the side of the room. Instead, keep your elbows pointing to the floor. <br><br>

                            • Aim to complete sets of 8 to 12 reps. Start with one set and work up to two to three sets over time as you build strength. When you finish your set, safely exit the exercise by sitting up and placing the dumbbells on your knees before you stand up. Avoid dropping the dumbbells while you're lying on the incline bench. <br><br>

                    <p>This exercise targets the triceps. Hold a dumbbell with both hands behind your head. Keep your elbows close to your ears and extend your arms upwards, then slowly lower back to starting position. <br><br>

                        • By using dumbbells instead of a EZ-bar for the overhead extension you work each arm separately and ensure one stronger side isn’t carrying the weaker one, but it’s also worth doing the exercise with one arm at a time. This lets you focus on perfect form in that one arm, and also allows for a greater range of motion so you can be sure you’re working every part of the triceps with the move. As with all forms of the exercise, make sure you don’t overdo it with the weight you use and ideally you want to be able to rest the weight evenly in both palms

                • Lie on the bench, under the rack that holds the bar. Your eyes should be roughly aligned with the front of the barbell rack uprights. Your butt, shoulders, and head are flat on the bench with a neutral spine. Your feet are flat on the floor and relatively wide apart. <br><br>

• Lie on your back on a flat bench. Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. The bar should be directly over the shoulders. <br><br>

• Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout the entire movement.<br><br>

• Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement. Avoid arching your back. <br><br>

• Slowly lift the bar or dumbbells off the rack, if using. Lower the bar to the chest, about nipple level, allowing elbows to bend out to the side, about 45 degrees away from the body. <br><br>

• Stop lowering when your elbows are just below the bench. Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position. <br><br>

• Perform 5 to 10 reps, depending on weight used. Perform up to 3 sets.

            <p>• Sit comfortably on the pulldown seat, with your feet flat on the floor. Check the height of the bar. You may need to adjust the bar height by shortening or lengthening the chain or cable that supports the bar or your seat height. Get a gym trainer to help with this if necessary <br><br>

                • Take a comfortable seat facing the machine and place the thigh pads on the top of your quads, somewhere between your knees and hip flexor crease. You may need to adjust the seat height so that when you sit on the seat pad, your feet are flat on the floor with your knees at a 90-degree angle. Proper posture makes a big difference in muscle activation and the overall effectiveness of the lat machine, so checking the seat height is really important.<br><br>
                
                • Press the thigh pads down and lock them into place in a position that’s firm, but not uncomfortable or too tight. The goal of the thigh pads is to keep your body grounded on the seat pad, especially when you’re pulling heavier weight, so while you don’t want them too far away from your thighs, it’s OK if they’re not directly touching. You’ll need a little wiggle room in between the thigh pads and your legs when you stand back up.<br><br>
                
                • Next, make sure your shins are snug against the ankle pads, with your feet shoulder-width apart and planted firmly on the ground. This helps keep you grounded and in proper posture so that you can have the best lat pulldown machine workout ever! <br><br>
                
                • On to the next part of the setup as we work toward mastering the perfect lat pulldown exercise. But first, double check that the correct bar attachment is connected to the unit. It should look similar to a bar that you would use to do pull-ups; it can have hand grips, but it should not have a handle. There will likely be a slight bend in the bar right before the hand grips.

                • For the barbell hip thrust, begin by using a barbell with a weight that you can control for 2–3 sets of 6–12 repetitions. Choose a weight that allows you to maintain good technique throughout all sets and repetitions. <br><br>

                • Place a loaded barbell parallel to a bench. <br><br>
                
                • Sit on the floor with your back up against the bench. Roll the barbell over your hips until the barbell rests in the crease of your hips. <br><br>
                
                • With your upper back in contact with the bench, lift your hips slightly off of the ground. Your upper arms should rest against the bench. Rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats. The bottom of your shoulder blades should be in contact with the bench. The weight on your feet should be evenly distributed along each entire foot. Rotate your feet into the floor to create a stable foot position. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this position. <br><br>
                
                To begin the upward movement, squeeze your glutes and push your feet into the ground. <br><br>
                
                • Continue squeezing your glutes as you push your hips toward the ceiling to achieve full hip extension. Your core should be engaged to keep your ribs down and your pelvis should be slightly tucked at the top. Your shins should be vertical.<br><br>
                
                • Pause for 2–3 seconds at the top. <br><br>
                
                • To begin the downward movement, hinge from your hips to return to the starting position. Allow your chest to follow your hips. Gaze forward while keeping your chin tucked. Maintain tension on your glutes and keep your core engaged. Your torso should create a 45-degree angle with the ground at the bottom of the movement.<br><br>

            <p>• The front squat is what most people think of when they think of a weighted squat. It’s a great progression of the basic bodyweight squat. <br><br>

                • You’ll build strength in your quads, glutes, hamstrings and core, and up your power, too. <br><br>
                
                • To get moving: Safely load the barbell onto your traps and shoulders. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out, core braced, and chest up. <br><br>
                
                • Initiate a basic squat movement — hips back, knees bent, ensuring they fall out, not in. Pause when your thighs reach about parallel to the ground. <br><br>
                
                • Push through your entire foot to return to start.
